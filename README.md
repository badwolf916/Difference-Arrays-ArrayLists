Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists
This project demonstrates the conceptual differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java. It contains an example code that compares the two data structures and highlights key points such as flexibility, memory allocation, and performance.

Project Overview
In Java, both arrays and ArrayLists are used to store collections of elements. However, they differ in how they manage data, their size flexibility, and the types of operations they support. This project showcases:

Arrays: Fixed-size containers that store elements of the same type.
ArrayLists: Dynamic containers that can grow and shrink in size during runtime.
Conceptual Differences Between Arrays and ArrayLists:
Size Flexibility:

Arrays have a fixed size. Once created, their size cannot be changed.
ArrayLists are dynamic and can grow or shrink as needed.
Memory Allocation:

Arrays are allocated a contiguous block of memory based on their size, which is determined when they are created.
ArrayLists dynamically allocate memory as elements are added or removed, requiring additional overhead for resizing.
Performance:

Arrays offer faster access to elements because their size is fixed and memory is allocated contiguously.
ArrayLists may incur a slight performance cost due to resizing and additional methods for managing elements.
Ease of Use:

ArrayLists provide more built-in methods (e.g., add(), remove(), size()) which make them easier to use for dynamically managing data.
Arrays are more efficient when the number of elements is known in advance and the size does not change.
Code Example
The code demonstrates both an array and an ArrayList in Java. The array stores a fixed set of integers, while the ArrayList allows for dynamic addition of elements.

Code Explanation:
Array Example:
An array is created with a fixed size and populated with values. Elements are accessed using their index.

ArrayList Example:
An ArrayList is created, and elements are added dynamically. The size of the ArrayList can change during runtime, and elements are accessed using the get() method.

Code:

Edit
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class DifferenceArraysArrayLists {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Demonstrating Arrays
        int[] numArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println("Array Example:");
        for (int i = 0; i < numArray.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Element at index " + i + ": " + numArray[i]);
        }

        // Demonstrating ArrayList
        ArrayList<Integer> numArrayList = new ArrayList<>();
        numArrayList.add(1);
        numArrayList.add(2);
        numArrayList.add(3);
        System.out.println("\nArrayList Example:");
        for (int i = 0; i < numArrayList.size(); i++) {
            System.out.println("Element at index " + i + ": " + numArrayList.get(i));
        }
    }
}
How to Run the Project:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists project in your IDE.
Compile and run the DifferenceArraysArrayLists.java file.
Observe the output in the console, which will display both the array and ArrayList examples.
Conclusion
This project highlights the differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java. Arrays are suitable for scenarios where the number of elements is known beforehand, while ArrayLists are more appropriate when the number of elements may change over time.
